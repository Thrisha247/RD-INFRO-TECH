##📁 Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Basic Embedded System Setup
- Learned the basics of using microcontrollers.
- Configured the Arduino Uno board and environment.
- Wrote a simple program to *blink an LED* using GPIO.

### ✅ Task 2: Temperature Sensor Detection
- *Sensor Used:* LM35  
- *Microcontroller:* Arduino Uno  
- Read analog values from the LM35 sensor.
- Converted sensor values into temperature in *°C*.
- Displayed temperature output on the *Serial Monitor*.

### ✅ Task 3: PWM for Motor Control
- Implemented *Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)*.
- Controlled *DC motor speed* using varying duty cycles.
- Interfaced *L293D Motor Driver* with Arduino.
- Gained insight into duty cycle behavior and real-time control.

### ⚙️ Task 4: IoT-Based Device Control (Optional)
- Connected *ESP8266 Wi-Fi module*.
- Controlled LEDs/devices via a *web-based interface*.
- Explored *MQTT and HTTP protocols* for device communication.
